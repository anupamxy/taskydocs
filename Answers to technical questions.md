1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent around 4 hours working on the coding test. The process involved understanding the requirements, designing a solution, implementing the features, testing the app, and refining the code to ensure everything worked smoothly. Each stage was critical in ensuring that the final product was functional and met the expectations.

2. What was the most useful feature added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
Async/Await: One of the most transformative features in JavaScript (ES6 and later) has been the introduction of async/await. This feature simplifies handling asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable by eliminating callback chains or nested .then() calls.

JSX in React: Another key feature that has revolutionized the development experience is JSX (JavaScript XML). JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, making it easier to structure UI components and view templates within React.

Here’s how I've used these features:

javascript
Copy code
// Fetching user data asynchronously using async/await
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user data:', error);
  }
}

// JSX in React: UserProfile component
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To identify and resolve performance issues in production, I would follow these steps:

Log Analysis: The first step is to analyze both server and client-side logs. Logs often contain errors or warnings that can indicate slow processes or bugs affecting performance.

Profiling Tools:

Frontend: I would use browser dev tools, particularly the "Performance" tab, to pinpoint bottlenecks in the app, like long page load times or slow JavaScript execution.
Backend: On the server side, I'd rely on monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog to track API response times and identify slow server-side processes.
Unnecessary Re-renders & Memory Leaks: If the issue is React-specific, I'd use React DevTools to track unnecessary re-renders. I’d also inspect memory usage to detect leaks by ensuring proper cleanup in useEffect hooks.

Database Optimization: If the issue is database-related, I’d check query performance, add proper indexing, and optimize queries to reduce latency.

Load Testing: Finally, I’d run load tests using tools like Apache JMeter or Artillery to simulate high traffic and measure how well the app performs under stress.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
If I had more time, I'd focus on integrating the following advanced features to further enhance the task management application:

AI-Powered Task Suggestions: Integrate AI to provide smart suggestions for tasks based on user behavior or calendar events. This feature could automatically categorize tasks, prioritize them, or even remind users of upcoming deadlines. It would involve machine learning to predict which tasks are most urgent based on historical patterns.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enhance the search functionality with NLP, allowing users to query tasks using natural language. For example, users could type, "Show all tasks due tomorrow" or "Find high-priority tasks," and the app would intelligently filter tasks based on the query.

Task Automation: Implement task automation where certain tasks trigger others based on conditions (e.g., "When Task 1 is completed, Task 2 is automatically started"). This would help users automate repetitive workflows, improving their productivity.

Task Analytics & Insights: Provide users with insights into their task completion habits. For example, show analytics such as average task completion time, most completed categories, or overdue task statistics, helping users optimize their task management.

Enhanced Notifications: Integrate push notifications, email reminders, or even SMS alerts to notify users of upcoming deadlines, task completion statuses, or important changes to their tasks.
