## 1. **How long did you spend on the coding test?**
I spent around **4 hours** working on the coding test. The process involved:

- **Understanding the requirements**: Analyzing the problem statement and breaking it down.
- **Designing a solution**: Creating the necessary architecture for the app.
- **Implementing the features**: Writing the code to meet functional requirements.
- **Testing**: Ensuring the app works correctly.
- **Refining the code**: Cleaning up the code and making sure itâ€™s optimized.

Each stage was critical in ensuring that the final product was functional and met expectations.

## 2. **What was the most useful feature added to the latest version of your chosen language?**

### **Async/Await** (JavaScript)
One of the most transformative features in **JavaScript** (ES6 and later) has been the introduction of `async/await`. It simplifies handling asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable by eliminating callback chains or nested `.then()` calls.

### **JSX in React**
Another key feature that has revolutionized the development experience is **JSX (JavaScript XML)**. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, making it easier to structure UI components and view templates within React.

#### Code Examples:

```javascript
// Fetching user data asynchronously using async/await
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user data:', error);
  }
}
```

```jsx
// JSX in React: UserProfile component
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3. **How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?**

### Steps to Track Performance Issues:

1. **Log Analysis**: 
   - Check both **server** and **client-side logs** for any errors or warnings.
   - Logs often indicate slow processes or bugs affecting performance.

2. **Profiling Tools**:
   - **Frontend**: Use browser dev tools (especially the **Performance** tab) to pinpoint bottlenecks like slow page loads or JavaScript execution.
   - **Backend**: Use monitoring tools like **New Relic** or **Datadog** to track API response times and identify slow processes.

3. **Unnecessary Re-renders & Memory Leaks**:
   - Use **React DevTools** to track unnecessary re-renders.
   - Inspect memory usage to detect leaks by ensuring proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks.

4. **Database Optimization**:
   - Check **query performance** on the server side.
   - Add **indexes** and optimize queries to reduce latency.

5. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate high traffic using tools like **Apache JMeter** or **Artillery** to measure how the app performs under stress.

## 4. **If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?**

If I had more time, I would focus on integrating the following advanced features to enhance the task management application:

### **AI-Powered Task Suggestions**
- Integrate AI to provide smart suggestions for tasks based on user behavior or calendar events.
- AI could predict which tasks are most urgent based on historical patterns.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Search**
- Enhance the search functionality with NLP, allowing users to query tasks using natural language.
- For example: "Show all tasks due tomorrow" or "Find high-priority tasks."

### **Task Automation**
- Implement task automation where certain tasks trigger others based on conditions.
- E.g., "When Task 1 is completed, Task 2 starts automatically."

### **Task Analytics & Insights**
- Provide users with insights into their task completion habits.
- For example, show analytics such as **average task completion time**, **most completed categories**, and **overdue task statistics**.

### **Enhanced Notifications**
- Integrate **push notifications**, **email reminders**, or even **SMS alerts** to notify users of upcoming deadlines, task completion statuses, or important changes.
